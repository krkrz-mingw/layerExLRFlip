# layerExLRFlip

This Kirikiri (2/Z) plugin provides a modular replacement for `Layer.flipLR`.

## Building

After cloning submodules and placing `ncbind` and `tp_stub` in the parent directory, a simple `make` will generate `layerExLRFlip.dll`.

## How to use

After `Plugins.link("layerExLRFlip.dll");` is used, the additional functions will be exposed under the `Layer` class.
